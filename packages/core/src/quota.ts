 * count therefore has one job — know when to ask the user to write again, *before* the last slot is
 * spent, because the ask is itself a message.
 *
 * It lives in `core` rather than in the host because the counting has to be shared. An agent that
 * writes its own script to send a timed series cannot be counted by the plugin at all, which is why
 * `dsh-wechat-send` exists; the command and the plugin both charge against this ledger, so the ten
 * are counted the same way whichever process spends them, and the count survives a restart on both
 * sides.
