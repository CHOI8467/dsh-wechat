 * Conversation routing: one WeChat conversation maps to one DSH session, and the

 * client uses the same technique (it handles `/echo` and `/toggle-debug` in chat),
 * and the protocol's tool-call item types could eventually render something
 * richer. Commands work today, on every client, with no extra payload.
 *
 * Session ids are minted by this router in DSH's own format (`session-<uuid>`) and
 * handed to the session controller, which adopts an existing session with that id
 * or creates one. The mapping is what survives a restart, so a chat keeps talking
 * to the same session across reboots.
