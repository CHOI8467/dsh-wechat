/**
 * `@dsh-wechat/core` — a client for the Tencent iLink Bot API, which is the
 * backend behind the official WeChat ClawBot plugin.
 *
 * The API is plain HTTP/JSON with an outbound long poll, so a machine running DSH
 * can receive WeChat messages from anywhere without a tunnel, a public address, or
 * any inbound port. This package contains only that client: no DSH imports, so it
 * can be unit-tested and reused on its own.
 *
 * Phase 1 covers text. Media transfer (AES-128-ECB plus Tencent CDN) is phase 2.
 *
 * @module @dsh-wechat/core
