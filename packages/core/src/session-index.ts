/**
 * Reading the session list from DSH's own on-disk store.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The host exposes `sessionController.list()`, and on the machine this was built for it returns an
 * empty array — so `/list` answered with nothing, and the agent had to read the store itself to
 * tell the user anything at all. The store is always there: DSH writes every session to
 * `<home>/sessions/<encoded-cwd>/<session-id>/`, and every title to
 * `<home>/storages/session_projcache/sessions/<uuid>.json`.
 *
 * ## Why the filter is not optional
 *
 * The store holds every workspace on the machine — 73 sessions for the author's project directory
 * against 9 for the channel's own. A session belonging to another workspace **cannot be adopted**:
 * the host pins `cwd` for the life of a session and rejects an adopt whose working directory
 * differs. Offering one would produce a list of conversations that all fail on selection, so only
 * the channel's own workspace is read.
